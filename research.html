                    <h3>Digital Simulation of Topological Systems</h3>
                    Using digital quantum computers based on qubits and gates, we have introduced methods for realising and studying topological systems. This includes the largest scale implementation of the toric code on Google's sycamore chip [1]. We additionally measure several topological properties of the system and its excitations and propose generalisations beyond the toric code [2]. We have also proposed methods for studying symmetry protected topological phases across a phase transition in [3]. 

                    <h3>Digital Simulation of Many-Body Dynamics</h3>
                    I have been working with the state-of-the-art IBM quantum computers to simulate far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics [4,5]. These types of simulations generally require computation resources that scale exponentially in system size. This is problematic even for the worlds most powerful classical supercomputers, which can tackle at most ~50 spins (qubits). Quantum computers may provide a way to directly simulate this quantum dynamics with physical resources scaling only linearly with system size, an exponential improvement! Our work investigates the capabilities and limitations of using current and near-term quantum computers for this purpose.

                    <h3>Analogue Simulation of Time-Dependent Hamiltonians</h3>
                    Motivated by the access offered by IBM to the low level microwave pulse control of their quantum computers, I am investigating the possibilities of using these devices for analogue simulations. By controlling the microwave pulses directly it is possible to realise time-dependent Hamiltonians for a single qubit and coupling arrays of qubits. As a first step, Daniel Malz and I performed an experiment where we drove a single superconducting qubit with two incommensurate frequencies [6]. This experiment followed an earlier proposal and confirmed the presence of a temporal topological band structure. We were able to accurately extract the quantised Chern number that characterises the different topological phases.
