I am a condensed matter theorist studying non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum systems. I am currently a PhD student with [Dr. Dmitry Kovrizin](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/kovrizhin) in the [Theory of Condensed Matter](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/profiles/as2457/) group, Cambridge.

Please take a look at my list of [publications](/publications) and my [research interests](/research).
