<p>Thank you for your interest in joining my group. We are currently looking for Postdocs and PhD student to join the Condensed Matter Theory group at the University of Nottingham</p>

<h2>Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>

<p> Applications are invited (<a href="">see here</a>) for one or more full-time postdoctoral research positions in the Condensed Matter Theory group of the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, to be supervised by one or more of Bruno Bertini, Kay Brandner, Juan P. Garrahan, Stephen Powell and Adam Smith. </p>
    
<p> If you are interested, please contact us 
<ul>
    <li>Adam Smith - adam.smith1[at]nottingham.ac.uk</li>
    <li>Bruno Bertini - bruno.bertini[at]nottingham.ac.uk</li>
    <li>Kay Brandner - kay.brandner[at]nottingham.ac.uk</li>
    <li>Juan P. Garrahan - juan.garrahan[at]nottingham.ac.uk</li>
    <li>Stephen Powell - stephen.powell[at]nottingham.ac.uk</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
    Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): quantum and classical non-equilibrium systems; open-system theory; non-Markovian dynamics; quantum and stochastic thermodynamics; large deviations; statistical mechanics of machine learning; frustrated magnetism and spin liquids; topological order and fractionalisation; quantum computing and simulation; unitary circuits; quantum machine learning; quantum-enhanced numerical methods; dynamics of quantum information; quantum many-body chaos. </p>
