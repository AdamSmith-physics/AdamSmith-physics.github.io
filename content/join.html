<p>Thank you for your interest in joining my group. I was recently awarded and <b>ERC Starting Grant</b> and we are looking for Postdocs and PhD students to join the Condensed Matter Theory group at the University of Nottingham</p>
		

<h2>PhD Students</h2>

<p> If you are interested in a PhD position in my group then please email me (adam.smith1[at]nottingham.ac.uk) to discuss possible projects. </p>

<p> The application process for the University of Nottingham can be found <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/course/research/physics-phd">here</a>. </p>


<h2>Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>

<p> If you are interested in a Postdoc position in my group, please contact me (adam.smith1[at]nottingham.ac.uk). You will be granted substantial freedom in my group. There are also several fellowships worth applying to, including:
<ul>
    <li>Nottingham Research Fellowship </li>
    <li>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships</li>
    <li>Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851</li>
    <li>Leverhulme Fellowships</li>
