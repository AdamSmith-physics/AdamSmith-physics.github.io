<p>Thank you for your interest in joining my group. I was recently awarded an <b>ERC Starting Grant</b> and we are looking for Postdocs and PhD students to join the Condensed Matter Theory group at the University of Nottingham</p>
		

<h2>Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>

<p> If you are interested in a Postdoc position in my group, we currently have an open position for a <a href="https://jobs.nottingham.ac.uk/vacancy.aspx?ref=SCI371524">Research Fellow/Associate</a> in Condensed Matter Theory at the University of Nottingham. This position is initially offered for two years. The start date is flexible, but the successful candidate would need to be in post prior to 1st March 2025.</p>

<!--<p> I am regularly looking for Postdocs to join my group. There is currently no open position, but feel free to email me (adam.gammon-smith[at]nottingham.ac.uk) to discuss potential future openings. </p>-->
    
<p>There are also several fellowships worth applying to, including:
<ul>
    <li>Nottingham Research Fellowship </li>
    <li>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships</li>
    <li>Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851</li>
    <li>Leverhulme Fellowships</li>
</ul>    
and several others.
