        I am a condensed matter theorist interested primarily in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, particularly quantum quenches of lattice models. I am also interested in topologically ordered systems, quantum computation and machine learning. My current research focus is on using quantum computers and tools from machine learning to study many-body quantum physics.

        I am an Associate Professor at the University of Nottingham and was recently awarded an <b>ERC Starting Grant</b>. Please find more details of my research interests <a href="research.html">here</a>, and my publications can be found <a href="publications.html">here</a>, on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/smith_a_7.html">arXiv</a>, and on my <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=0sCuBC4AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>   page.

        In 2020 I was awarded a research fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. Previously I was at the Technische Universität München in the group of Frank Pollmann. Before this I was a research associate at Imperial College London with Prof. Myungshik Kim and Dr. Johannes Knolle. This position was part of a collobaration between Imperial College and Samsung to simulate quantum systems with the IBM quantum computers. I completed my PhD entitled “Disorder-free Localization” at the University of Cambridge with Dr. Dmitry Kovrizhin. Before that I studied for a Masters in Physics at Cambridge, and did my undergraduate studies at the University of Leeds.
