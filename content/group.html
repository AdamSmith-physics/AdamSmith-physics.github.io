            My general research interests are in many-body physics and non-equilibrium systems. I am currently focused on the realisation of Majorana fermions in heterostructures that give rise to topological superconductivity. Primarily using analytical techniques, I explore how the Majorana fermions arise in vortices and the properties they have, especially those that will allow for their experimental verification, such as their non-Abelian statistics.

            My research interests lie specifically in the areas of quantum entanglement, spin chains, and many-body physics. I am interested to know the properties of quantum many-body systems, with a particular emphasis on the role of entanglement in these systems. I investigate the properties of spin chains, such as their ground-state properties and dynamics, and analyze the entanglement properties of these systems using a variety of theoretical and numerical methods.

            Overall, my research in many-body physics aims to deepen our understanding of the fundamental principles of entanglement, spin chains, and many-body physics, with the ultimate goal of developing practical applications in areas such as quantum information processing and quantum computing.

            My research interests lie in the area of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Specifically, I am interested in the dynamical fluctuations and large deviations of classical stochastic processes, and the dynamics of quantum many-body systems subject to kinetic constraints. Much of my work includes the application of numerical tensor network methods for non-equilibrium dynamics.

            My research interests are currently focused on the dynamics of various many-body systems after quenching. My first project in the group is based on the quasiparticle description for entanglement growth. This description provides an exact picture for entanglement in the semiclassical limit and assuming that correlations do not develop between quasiparticles over time. 
            <!--One then uses the fact that systems with certain symmetries - in our case, free-fermionic systems with a translation symmetry - have an underlying structure to the correlations of these quasiparticles. Through this structure one can achieve much greater computational efficiency of entanglement in comparison to the standard numerical approach. -->
            The aim of our project is to extend the above case from previous literature to general translation invariant initial states and to higher spatial dimension.
